## Competency and Learning Objectives

### Competency:

Git Branching and Merging

### Learning Objectives:

- I can create a feature branch from main and move between branches.
- I can use the git diff command to compare the code in two branches line by line
- I can merge a feature branch into main on my local machine.
- I can open a pull request into main on GitHub and merge that feature branch, closing the PR.
- I can update my local main branch with the merged code from the remote repository.
- I can engage in branching, committing, and merging best practices

## Introduction

Throughout the early chapters of this program, you learned the basics of using `git` to get
starter code from remote repositories, and to commit and push changes to your own copies of
those repositories on GitHub. 

Your view of a Git repository so far has been a linear history of commits, but Git is actually a
powerful tool for managing multiple lines of development at the same time.  This is done through
the use of branches, which allow you to create separate lines of development that can diverge
from the main line of history and later be merged back into the main branch or other branches.

In this chapter, we will explore how to use the `git` tools that we have learned to create and
manage branches, merge changes, and resolve conflicts. We will also learn how to push these
different branches to a remote repository on GitHub.
