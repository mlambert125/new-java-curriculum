- I can explain IOC and Dependency Injection.
- I can create a new Spring Boot application using Spring Initializr.

## Introduction

So far, you've likely been writing object-oriented java programs that interact with the console.  It's time to move on
to more complex applications - specifically spring web applications.  A web application is a software application that
acts as a web server and listens for incoming requests from a browser and responds with HTML or other data.

Spring is a framework that makes it easier to build web applications.  A framework is a collection of libraries and
tools that help you build software.

## Frameworks

A framework is a collection of libraries and tools that help you build software.  A framework typically uses a technique
called inversion of control (IOC) to let you easily start up the framework and then simply write classes that customize
the behavior of the framework, and let the framework discover and apply your classes in the project automatically.

The advantage of this approach is that you do not need to write a lot of boilerplate code to start up the framework and
you do not need to write a lot of code to connect your classes to the framework.  The framework does this for you.
