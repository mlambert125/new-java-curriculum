## Competency and Learning Objectives

### Competency:

Git Collaboration

### Learning Objectives:

- I can explain best practices in Git workflow, including engaging in a consistent workflow practice,
preventing merge conflicts, and performing code reviews.
- I can add collaborators to a single GitHub repository.
- I can resolve merge conflicts.
- I can assign, review, respond, and approve reviews on a collaboratorâ€™s PR at specific lines of code.

## Introduction

At this point in the course, you have learned the basics of using `git` to get starter code from 
remote repositories, and to commit and push changes to your own copies of those repositories on
GitHub.  You have also learned to understand git branching and the branching graph nature of a Git
repository.

Git is useful as an individual, but it's real power comes when you use it to collaborate with
others.  Git allows multiple people to work on the same codebase at the same time and offers
powerful tools to manage changes, resolve conflicts, and review code.  GitHub, as a hosting
platform for Git repositories, enhances this collaboration by providing a user-friendly interface,
issue tracking, and pull requests for code reviews.

In this chapter, we will explore how to use the `git` tools that we have learned and the GitHub
repository hosting platform to build collaborative software projects.
