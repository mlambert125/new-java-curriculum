## Competency and Learning Objectives

### Competency:

Java Basics

### Learning Objectives:

- I can write java applications that make use of Java's collection classes.

## Introduction

When writing java applications, we sometimes need to store several values together in a single variable so that they
can be accessed and manipulated as a group. You have likely used arrays to do this in the past, but Java provides
a number of other collection classes that can be used to store and manipulate groups of values. In this lesson, we will
explore some of the most commonly used collection classes in Java.

This lesson assumes that you have a basic understanding of how to write simple Java programs using IntelliJ, and that
you are familiar with core language concepts such as variables, data types, and control structures.
